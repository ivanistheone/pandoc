Essential things before can "request to pull":
  - finish other doku specific changes
  - write docs (explain that we assume jsmath pluing is present)
  - write tests

Wishlist:
  - see how I can make isSimpleList accept lists with math in them


# comment
# WOOOOW I am sooo impressed with Haskell
# I never knew the language, but it clean and simple to learn
# it is just like lisp with math syntax
